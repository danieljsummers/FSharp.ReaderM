# FSharp.ReaderM
An implementation of the Reader monad in F#

This project arose out of my desire to use this pattern in different projects, but not wanting to copy/paste it over
and over. Feel free to use it; PRs are welcome, as I am not a monad expert.

### Credits

The code here was created based on prior work from several individuals:
 - Carsten KÃ¶nig and his "[Dependency Injection - A Functional Way][ck]" post
 - Matthew Podwysokci and his "[Much Ado about Monads - Reader Edition][mp]" post
 - Scott Wlaschin and his "[Reinventing the Reader Monad][sw]" post (and that entire series)
 - Chet Husk and his one-on-one feedback to [my first attempt to use this][ch]

_(Sorry, Scott - I'm still not ready to [write a monad tutorial][tut]...)_
